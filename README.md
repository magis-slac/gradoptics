# Differentiable Optics via Ray Tracing
[*gradoptics*](https://github.com/magis-slac/gradoptics) is a ray tracing based optical simulator built using PyTorch [[1]](#1) to enable automatic differentiation. 

The API is designed similar to rendering softwares, and has been heavily inspired by *Physically Based Rendering* (Pharr, Jakob, Humphreys) [[2]](#2). 


## Getting Started
[Getting Started](https://github.com/magis-slac/gradoptics/blob/main/docs/tutorials/Quick-Start.ipynb)


## Installation


```commandline
pip install gradoptics
```

Then, you should be ready to go!
```python
import gradoptics as optics
```

## Work in progress
- Currently, some optical element normals are aligned with the optical axis -> more general orientations in progress
- Currently, monochromatic -> no chromatic aberrations

## Project History

This project was started in 2020 by Michael Kagan and Maxime Vandegar at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory.
